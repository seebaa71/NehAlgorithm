# NehAlgorithm

The program presented  NEH algorithm to solve Flow shop scheduling problems

There are n machines and m jobs. Each job contains exactly n operations. The i-th operation of the job must be executed on the i-th machine. No machine can perform more than one operation simultaneously. For each operation of each job, execution time is specified.
